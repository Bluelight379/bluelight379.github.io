        <p>Just kidding! But seriously, phishing is a real threat. Here are some tips to avoid getting phished:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Be suspicious of unsolicited emails or messages:</strong> Phishing attempts often come disguised as legitimate communications.</li>
            <li><strong>Check the sender's email address:</strong> Look for misspellings or unusual domain names.</li>
            <li><strong>Hover over links before clicking:</strong> Verify that the link leads to a legitimate website.</li>
            <li><strong>Never enter personal information on unencrypted websites:</strong> Look for "https" in the URL and a padlock icon in the address bar.</li>
            <li><strong>Keep your software up to date:</strong> Security updates often include protection against phishing attacks.</li>
            <li><strong>Use a password manager:</strong>  This helps generate and store strong, unique passwords.</li>
            <li><strong>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):</strong> This adds an extra layer of security to your accounts.</li>
        </ol>
